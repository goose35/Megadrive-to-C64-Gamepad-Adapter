# Megadrive-to-C64-Gamepad-Adapter

Rev 1.0 and 1.1

rev 1.0 i had 10 boards made but the have errors. They can be used with mods as per the readme pdf.
Rev 1.1 erros correceted

After refurbing a Sega Megadrive recently I wondered it the game pad could be used on the C64. After some research I found they could but could potentially cause damage to the CIA chips by causing 5v from the C64 to directly short via th gamepad when pressing the select button. Some have stated they used the pads without damage and others stated the opposite, so it seems the former may have been lucky.
Further research found a DIY adapter schematic from an issue of Commodore World 
So I set about designing a PCB in Ki-Cad and this is it
